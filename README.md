## Deployed Website

https://jessgreene9.github.io/jess-greene-portfolio/

## Description

This is a professional portfolio highlighting the skills of the web developer's background. Within the portfolio, one will find background information, projects the developer has completed, and contact information. A recent picture and the developer's name is included. 

This site allows a prospective employer to view an short bio on the homepage and the navigation bar at the top allows easy access to a projects page as well as a page with contact information. Also included in this section is an easily downloadable PDF file containing the developer's resume. 

The site includes 6 recent projects with links to both the deployed site as well as the Github repository. 

This webpage is responsive and will adjust to a smaller view-point for readability. The contact links at the bottom of the page will allow a potential employer to access the developer's Github repositories as well as be able to click the email link and automatically be brought to a new email message. A link to their LinkedIn profile is also included.
